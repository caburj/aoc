# AoC 2023

This my attempt to participate to the Advent of Code 2023.

## Solutions

A problem with two parts will be revealed each day. My solutions are named
`day_{day_number}.py`. Each solution is standalone and can be run using
`python day_01.py`.

Each solution assumes the presence of `input_{day_number}.txt` file as input.

Some solutions asserts the test data. If interested, make the test data
available by creating the file named `input_{day_number}_test.txt` (e.g.
`input_01_test.txt`)
